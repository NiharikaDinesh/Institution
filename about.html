          <p>Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018.
            The most common cancers are:



Lung (2.09 million cases)
Breast (2.09 million cases)
Colorectal (1.80 million cases)
Prostate (1.28 million cases)
Skin cancer (non-melanoma) (1.04 million cases)
Stomach (1.03 million cases)</p>

<p>Tobacco use, alcohol use, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity are major cancer risk factors worldwide
  and are also the 4 shared risk factors for other noncommunicable diseases.Between 30–50% of cancers can
  currently be prevented by avoiding risk factors and implementing
  existing evidence-based prevention strategies. The cancer burden can also be reduced through early
  detection of cancer and management of patients who develop cancer.</p>

<p>Approximately 12 million girls aged 15–19 years and at least 777,000 girls under 15 years give birth each year in developing regions.
At least 10 million unintended pregnancies occur each year among adolescent girls aged 15–19 years in the developing world.
Complications during pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death for 15–19-year-old girls globally.
Of the estimated 5.6 million abortions that occur each year among adolescent girls aged 15–19 years, 3.9 million are unsafe, contributing to maternal mortality, morbidity and lasting health problems.
Adolescent mothers (ages 10–19 years) face higher risks of eclampsia, puerperal endometritis, and systemic infections than women aged 20 to 24 years, and babies of adolescent mothers face higher risks of low birth weight, preterm delivery and severe neonatal conditions.</p>

          <p >Globally, children under age 15 account for about 5 per cent of all people living with HIV,
             9 per cent of new HIV infections and 14 per cent of all AIDS-related deaths. Children under
              1 year of age are among those most vulnerable to HIV. Evidence shows that early initiation of
              antiretroviral drugs in infants with HIV can save lives; yet, coverage of critical intervention
              among children remains too low. 90% of those who know their status to be on treatment, and
              90% of those on treatment to be virally suppressed and sustained.  Renewed focus has been called
              to strategically target more decentralized diagnostics and clinical management for children exposed
               and living with HIV, as well as integration with maternal, child and adolescent services at
               facilities and within communities.</p>
